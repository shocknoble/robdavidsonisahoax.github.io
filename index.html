        <h6>or</h6>
        <p>How the US government convinced an entire community of Michigan teenagers that a being who was very
            clearly not of this world could fill the role of a seemingly normal adolescent boy despite all of the
            evidence against "him" and his case</p>

        <b>Editor's Note: <br>
        Despite the scientific inaccuracy, our subject (Robert Davidson) will be referred to as "he/him/his" and, often times, just as "Rob" throughout our journey together. We do not know of what world Robert has come from, but because of his appearance it is both conceptually and semantically simplest to refer to Robert with male pronouns.</b>

        <p id="warningHeader"> DISCLAIMER</p>
        <p class="warningBody">The content you will find on this page is not expected to disturb individuals who have neither met Rob Davidson or live in the Michigan-Chicago area. As long as you do not plan to frequent either of these areas, chances of meeting or hearing about him are slim/none, as he has done nothing noteworthy thus far.</p>

            Continuing on from this point if you are already acquantied with Robert Davidson has a <i>*very*</i> high likelyhood of tainting your relationship with him.
            <br><br>
            Likewise, there is a much higher chance of coming into contact with other individuals seen in some pictures below, as most of them have led some significant endeavor or another in their lifetimes. <br>***********************************<br> IF YOU ARE TO EVER MEET ONE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS IT IS IMPERATIVE YOU DO NOT MENTION THESE FINDINGS TO THEM
            <br>***********************************<br>
            If they make it clear they are already aware, you are free to discuss your thoughts and feelings, but we cannot risk Robert becoming aware of our studies until our research is conclusive. Legal reprecussions are already set in place for those unwilling to abide.
