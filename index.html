        <p>How the US government convinced an entire community of Michigan teenagers that a being who was very
            clearly not of this world could fill the role of a seemingly normal adolescent boy despite all of the
            evidence against "him" and his case</p>

        <b>Editor's Note: <br>
        Despite the scientific inaccuracy, our subject (Robert Davidson) will be referred to as "he/him/his" and, often times, just as "Rob" throughout our journey together. We do not know of what world Robert has come from, but because of his appearance it is both conceptually and semantically simplest to refer to Robert with male pronouns.</b>

        <p class="warningBody">The content you will find on this page is not expected to disturb individuals who have neither met Rob Davidson or live in the Michigan-Chicago area. As long as you do not plan to frequent either of these areas, chances of meeting or hearing about him are slim/none, as he has done nothing noteworthy thus far.</p>

            Continuing on from this point if you are already acquantied with Robert Davidson has a <i>*very*</i> high likelyhood of tainting your relationship with him.
